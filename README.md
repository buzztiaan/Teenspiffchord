This is code (and a 3D design for printing) for a chorded keyboard.

Inspiration was pulled from http://chorder.cs.vassar.edu/spiffchorder%3Aforside .
I also grabbed his .h for the keyboard layouts.

This uses internal pullups for the buttons, and a teensyduino library for debouncing buttons.

End product is just a normal USB keyboard :) Pictures on https://imgur.com/a/Sm1zr
